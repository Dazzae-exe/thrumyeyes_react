# Thrumyeyes Portfolio
Minimal portfolio of images for my personal photographer, Luis Jimenez. Which has a very peculiar eye to see the world differently than a normal human being expect to.

## Deployment
I choose GitHub Pages for this deployment that I don't need some very powerful hosting services beside what GitHub offers for us. Since I don't need to deal with backend for this project I start thinking this is the best bet to go for this project. 

My images are stored in a personal cloud and I need to renew them yearly.
